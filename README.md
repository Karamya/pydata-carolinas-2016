## Introduction

This set of activities give an introduction to deep language modeling, based on [this blog post](http://benjaminbolte.com/blog/2016/keras-language-modeling.html). It is ideal for people who are semi-comfortable using Theano or Tensorflow and have some familiarity with Keras, although if you've never tried any of them, the best way to learn is by doing!

The `install.sh` is a script I wrote to easily get it set up on my Mac, but it should work on a Linux system as well. The basic dependencies are Jupyter (duh), Theano, Keras and matplotlib.

## Outline

1. Theano XOR: The "Hello, world!" program. Implement a feed-forward network which learns an XOR function.
2. Keras XOR: Showing that it is a lot easier and faster to use Keras.
3. Word Embeddings: Understanding how word embeddings can help.
4. Recurrent Networks: Building recurrent networks in Theano, and showing how much easier it is in Keras.
5. Attentional RNNs: Modifying Keras to do special things.

## Expanding

If you want to contribute something, feel free! Just make sure it is grammatically correct and all the code works.
